You can access two different admin panels, for Etherpad by accessing `__DOMAIN____PATH__/admin` and for MyPads by `__DOMAIN____PATH__/mypads/?/admin`. 
You can also find a configuration file for Etherpad at this path `__INSTALL_DIR__/settings.json`.

*Skin Builder* (accessible at this address `https://__DOMAIN____PATH__/pad/p/test#skinvariantsbuilder`) allows you to customize the skin of your pad. It will give you a parameter to copy into your configuration file `__INSTALL_DIR__/settings.json`.
